## 01. What is Design?

In reference to product design, Wikipedia defines design as:

> _A plan or specification for the construction of an object or system or for the implementation of an activity or process_

In simplicity it is a plan to make something.

### What Design is not!

Design is not art.

As per [**Koos Looijesteijn**](https://www.kooslooijesteijn.net/), a brilliant product designer, Art is 

> _Art is a creation of which the main purpose is to convey an emotion._

Don't get it wrong. Design can be art. However its brief goes far beyond that. It is about **function** and looks serving a purpose.

## Local installation

Even though Jamdocs is so simple, you dont really need to set it up localy (you could just fork it on github to edit styles and md-files) - if you want to change it up a bit I recommend setting up localy for a better developer experience.

To set up a new instance of Jamdocs, and start developing just clone the project from Github like, go to the directory and run gridsome:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samuelhorn/jamdocs project-name
cd project-name
gridsome develop
```
